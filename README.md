# PCALipids

Principal components analysis a standart tool to study the conformational changes in molecule kinetics. Usually it is applied for the systems with several metastable states (local minimas of free energy landscapes) and helps to develop the possible transitions between this states and corresponding transition rates. But it also can be usefull to study the conformations of flexible molecules (the free energy lanscape has only 1 sharp local minima). PCAlipids is a python based software that enables to perform deep quantitative analysis of conformations and dynamics of flexible molecules. All the information about the approach could be found in the following papers:

* [Principal Component Analysis of Lipid Molecule Conformational Changes in Molecular Dynamics Simulations, Buslaev et al., JCTC 2016](doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5b01106)
* [Effects of Coarse Graining and Saturation of Hydrocarbon Chains on Structure and Dynamics of Simulated Lipid Molecules, Buslaev & Gushchin, Sci. Rep. 2017](doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-11761-5)

You could find the information on installation and a brief tutorial [here](https://github.com/membrane-systems/PCAlipids/blob/master/tutorial/tutorial.md).
